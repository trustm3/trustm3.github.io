# Certification

trust|me can be used to support different certification processes.
Some of the provided security features should allow to be used as TSF for Common Criteria certification
with trust|me as part of the Target of Evaluation (TOE).
As part of the trusted connector trust|me already got the IDS-ready label (Trust Profile) after having its implementation concept evaluated.

Remember that we only describe the features which are supported by the mainline implementation of trust|me
(consisting of the container management layer daemon _cmld_, the smartcard and security helper daemon _scd_, the trusted platform module 2 helper daemon _tmp2d_)
and the provided yocto based CML distribution, companioned by its reference c0 implementation trustx-coreos.

In a nutshell planned certifications are:

- Support for Common Criteria certification
- DIN SPEC 27070 - IDS Trust Security profile (ready label as part of the Trusted Connector already received)
- Support for IEC-62433 certification

## Security Functionality to support Common Criteria Evaluations

The following briefly described security functionality can support Common Criteria Evaluations
where the CML including its components cmld, tpm2d, scd as part of the Target of Evaluation (TOE) provides a secure isolation service for containers.

|TSF Description | Implementation / Components | State |
|--------------------|----------|--|
**CML Audit.** 	 Enables monitoring key events that occur in the components of the CML. It provides mechanisms to store and forward audit events occurring in the TOE (cmld itself) and it’s operational environment (OE) namely the Linux kernel. | cmld as auditd, kernel audit | done |
**CML Secure Container Init.** Ensures code integrity and authenticity for containers and their GuestOSes instantiated by the cmld. | UEFI secure boot, kernel module signing, IMA appraise for Linux firmware as trusteded computing base (TCB) for the CML; cmld and scd for containers | done |
**CML Container Isolation.** Ensures that no uncontrolled information exchange between containers is possible. Only a write-up according to the Bell-La Padula security model from c0 compartment to service containers is allowed. | cmld configures Linux namespaces, cgroups and capabilities | done |
**CML Container Data Storage.** Ensures data integrity, authenticity and confidentiality for service containers by utilizing a Secure Element as secure key storage. | cmld and scd using libctccid for SmartCardHSM integration, dm-crypt and dm-integrity | done |
**CML System Data Storage.** Ensures data confidentiality for CML data partition based on TPM as secure key storage | tpm2d and ibmtss for kernel dm-crypt | done |
**CML Device Access Control.** Ensure that only configured device access is allowed for a container. If exclusive access is configured, this is to be enforced by this TSF. | cmld configures device cgroups and network devices access (netns) | done |
**CML Updates.** Ensures that only authentic and integrity protected updates are performed, either to the security supporting parts of the OE – kernel, modules and firmware – as well as the TOE – the CML – and the compartment images and configuration. | cmld, scd | done |


## DIN SPEC 27070 - IDS-Specific Requirements
Relevant IDS-specific requirements specified in the DIN SPEC 27070 \[[DE](https://www.beuth.de/de/technische-regel/din-spec-27070/319111044)\]
